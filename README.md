# Project Management Assignment #1
Expedition 60
Indie Cinematic Turn-Based RPG

Project Management Plan

1. Concept Snapshot

Expedition 60 is an indie, turn-based role-playing game built around the idea of repeating expeditions into a collapsing world. Every sixty in-game days, the world resets, altering environments, enemies, and story outcomes. Players lead a small party on expeditions to uncover fragments of truth, improve their abilities, and prepare for the next cycle.

The focus of the game is:

Tactical turn-based combat

Party synergy and decision-making

A time-loop progression system

Strong atmosphere and narrative tone

This document outlines how the project will be managed, reviewed, and delivered over a six-month development cycle.

2. Team & Responsibility Breakdown

The development team consists of three members who are not part of my own group. As project manager, I assign responsibilities and monitor progress.

Name 1
Gameplay & Combat Systems
Responsible for turn order logic, combat actions, abilities, enemy behavior, and progression rules.

Name 2
World Design & Narrative Implementation
Responsible for expedition routes, story events, level flow, NPC interactions, and world logic.

Name 3
Interface, Testing & Documentation
Responsible for UI design, testing, balance feedback, bug tracking, and documentation.

3. Skill Check & Readiness Review

Before development began, a skills discussion was held during a 60-minute in-class session. The goal was to confirm:

Each member’s technical strengths

Availability across the six-month timeline

Comfort level with assigned responsibilities

The results showed that the team had sufficient coverage across gameplay logic, content creation, and quality assurance, making the project feasible within the given timeframe.

4. Development Window

Start Date: January 28, 2025

End Date: June 25, 2025

Total Duration: 6 months

The project is divided into three major checkpoints. Each checkpoint must be approved before the next phase begins and before payment is issued.

5. Checkpoints & Deliverables
Phase 1 – Definition Phase (Month 1)

Goal: Make sure the game is fully understood before building it.

Deliverables:

Game requirements document

Defined combat rules

Clear expedition mechanics

MVP scope agreement

Phase 2 – Build & Review Phase (Months 2–4)

Goal: Create a playable prototype that demonstrates the core experience.

Deliverables:

Turn-based combat prototype

One playable expedition route

Three party characters

Internal playtesting results

Design review notes

Phase 3 – Completion Phase (Months 5–6)

Goal: Polish, document, and deliver the final product.

Deliverables:

Final playable build

Bug fixes and balance pass

User controls guide

Gameplay explanation document

Final presentation/demo

6. How Work Is Tracked

All tasks are tracked using GitHub Projects with a lightweight workflow to keep things flexible:

Idea Pool

Planned

Active

Needs Review

Finished

Each task includes:

Owner

Short description

Expected outcome

This prevents over-planning while still providing accountability.

7. Quality & Design Evaluation

Instead of waiting until the end, quality checks are done continuously.

Key evaluation areas:

Is combat readable and fair?

Do expedition resets feel meaningful?

Is player choice clearly communicated?

Does difficulty scale appropriately?

Are failures recoverable and understandable?

Feedback from these checks is logged and addressed before moving forward.

8. Risks & Constraints

Main Risks

Scope creep (too many enemies, too much story)

Over-polishing visuals instead of gameplay

Balancing difficulty with limited testing time

Mitigation

Lock MVP early

Prioritize mechanics over content

Cut features instead of rushing them

9. Use of Class Time

The assigned 60-minute class period was used to:

Align on the game concept and tone

Confirm development roles

Identify potential risks early

Decide how progress would be demonstrated

Clarify milestone expectations

10. Personal Reflection

From a project management perspective, Expedition 60 is a strong but controlled idea. The core mechanic is interesting without requiring a massive content load. By focusing on one expedition route and one major encounter, the team can demonstrate quality rather than quantity.

The project is challenging but realistic, and it reflects real-world indie game development constraints where scope control and prioritization are essential.
